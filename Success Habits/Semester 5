    <h2>Lesson 24, How to Get Yourself Organized:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As you plan your life, resist the tempation of being over organized—it's an effectiveness killer.</li>
        <li>Running around with a stopwatch and keeping a totally clear desk isn't going to accomplish what you want in life.</li>

        <br>
        <br>

        <li>Organizing your workspace is largely a personal matter that depends on your own tastes and the job to be done. However, there are several basic factors to keep in mind:</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><li><em>Location</em>. If you are fortunate enough to choose your workspace, choose one that is conductive to performing the task. If the job requires concentration, look for a quiet, private place. On the other hand, if you are opening your own business, choose a well-traveled location where potential customers have easy access to your establishment.</li>
        <li><em>Space</em>. After you have chosen the proper work location, measure how much space you have to work with. Most of us usually find we have less than we want. It helps to know what space is available before furnishing it with the neccessary tools.</li>
        <li><em>Easy access to the tools you use frequently</em>. It helps here to make a list of the tools you use and rank them in order of how often you use them. Then you will have a guide to arranging them for easiest access.
            <br>
            Refrain from cluttering your workspace with nonessential items. The moosehead you had mounted after your last hunting trip to Canada may well be a sight worth seeing, but if it distracts you, you should place it somewhere else. Besides, it may occupy space where a more useful tool such as a memo board could be put.</li>
            <li><em>Comfort</em>. Some people don't believe that workspaces should be designed for comfort. They are generally people who play the hard-work tape or the work-is-inherently-unpleaseant tape. The fact is that discomfort is a distraction that serves only to hinder productivity. Why make things more difficult than they have to be? Life is already filled with a more than ample supply of discomforts, distractions, and frustrations.</li>
            A comfortable workspace generally has the proper seaating, ventilation, and lighting. If you work sitting down for long periods, choose a firm, comfortable chair that gives good back support. Try to find one comfortable enough that you won't have to get up every ten minutes, but not so comfortable that you will fall asleep in it. To avoid eyestrain use indirect, unifrom lighting.
            <br>
            Adequate ventilation will help prevent unnecassary fatigue from stuffiness in the work environment. Which tempature range you work best in is a personal matter. However, be sure to locate your place in the workspace out of a draft.</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>The following guidelines are designed to increase your desk-work effectiveness by reducing the amount of clutter.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><li>Have only one project at a time on top of your desk—it should be your top priority for the moment.</li>
        <li>Keep items off your desk until you are ready for them. Store them in file cabinets or drawers, but get them out of sight.</li>
        <li>Don't allow yourself to be sidetracked by other tasks because they are easier or more appealing. You should work on the top-priority item and keep at it until it is completed.</li>
        <li>When you complete a task, put it in the out basket and send it on its way. Then check your priorities and move on to the next item.</li>
        <li>If you have one, a secretary can help by keeping your desk clear and seeing that the day's top-priority item is waiting on your desk at the beginning of each day.</li>
        As I pointed out earlier, these are merely guidelines and they may not be suitable for you. Making a fetish out of a clean desk isn't going to get the job done, and for some it becomes just another detractor from effectively doing the job. Choose a style suitable for you and do the work to be done, but be honest with yourself. Few of us do our best work with a heavily cluttered and disorganized desk.</li> 
    </ol>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Whenever you need to concentrate, make it a habit to think with a pencil in your hand. As ideas come to you, jot them down. As you write down ideas, you will automatically be thinking them through and clarifying them in your mind. Soon you will have a list of thoughts to consider. You will be much more likely to see which ideas are irrational, erroneous, or in conflict with each other if you can view them all at once.</li>
        <li>One way to improve your ability to concentrate is to reserve your work place only for working. For example, if you work behind a desk in an office, don't do anything at your desk unrelated to work. If a visitor drops in, get up and move away from the desk. If you allow yourself to socialize behind the desk you will come to associate that location as more than a work location. When you take a break, move away from where you work. Sit in another chair or go to another room. If you develop the habit  of choosing a certain spot to work, you will find yourself getting down to business much more rapidly and automatically when it'a time to work.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Here are some ideas that you will find helpful in successfully finishing what you start:</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Get interested in your work. Interest and motivation go together like Siamese twins. Get more infortmation. The more you know about something the greater the odds you will become bsorbed in it.</li>
        <li>Try to imagine the satisfaction that will come from seeing the task achieved. Think of how much  better you'll look after you've shed those twenty pounds, or how much better you'll feel when you quit smoking. Think of the better job you will have and the happier life you'll lead when ypu finally get that degree or that promotion.</li>
        <li>Challenge yourself with deadlines for completion.</li>
        <li>Try to sheild yourself from interruptions and distractions.</li>
        <li>Take part in a joint effort with someone else who is dependable. When you make a commitment to do something with someone else, you are more likely to do the job than if you are tackle it alone. When i was in graduate school we would study in groups or pairs to reinforce our commitment to learn. We called it "cooperate and graduate." The important thing is that each person be dependable. If both parties are committed, each can set the pace for the other.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>When you are faced with a number of problems to solve, ask yourself which are the important ones and make them your first priority.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Lesson 25, How to Use the Law of Increasing Returns:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every man owes it to himself to do his best to find the sort of work he likes best.</li>
        <li>The one who engages in the sort of work he loves is generally rewarded with two very decided benefits, namely; first, he usually finds in such work the greatest of all rewards, HAPPINESS, which is priceless, and secondly, his actual reward in money, when averaged over a lifetime of effort, is generally much greater, for the reason that labor which is performed in a spirit of love is usually greater in quantity and finer in quality than that which is performed solely for money.</li>
        <li>There are more than a score of sound reasons why you should develop the habit of performing moe service and <em>better service</em> than that for which you are paid, despite the fact that a large majority of the people are not rendering such service.</li>
    </ul>
