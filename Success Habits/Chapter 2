<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to get a good idea of the importance of definiteness, you should watch nature in everything she does and you’ll get some very fine ideas. You should also observe the system of the human mind.</li>
        <li>Every human being should have definiteness and the impossibility of suspending even for one second, any of natures laws.</li>
        <li>Nature has penalties for the violation of all her laws. And rewards for the observation of them.</li>
        <li>There are three factors of applying definiteness of purpose. There must be a purpose, there must be a plan, and there must be an action.</li>
        <li>”Some of these days” never comes. You need to say a specific date that you will start something. That’s definite.</li>
        <li>Everything you do from the time you reached the age of consciousness of yourself until you die, is the result of a motive. Nobody does anything without a motive.</li>
        <li>You should not ask or except a person to do anything without planting, in their mind, a motive.</li>

        <br>
        <br>

        <li>There are 8 basic motives.</li>
        </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Love. It is the greatest of all of the motives and the greatest of all the emotions. And yet, the most dangerous.</li>
        <li>Material Wealth. One of the outstanding motives that inspire people to engage in great undertakings.</li>
        <li>Self-Preservation. Self-Preservation makes you feel superhuman. The desire for self-preservation is an outstanding motive.</li>
        <li>Freedom of body and mind.</li>
        <li>Personal Expression and Recognition. Personal expression is an inherit desire. It encourages people to engage in for reaching undertaking.</li>
        <li>Life After Death.</li>
        <li>Desire For Revenge. It wastes a LOT of energy. It can be real or imaginary but it is still a very destructive thing. It hurts you and other people.</li>
        <li>Fear. You have to become free in your own mind. If there’s something that you fear, find out why you fear it and get rid of that fear. If it’s something that you can do something about, do it. And if it’s something you can’t do anything about, forget about it, or at least fill your mind so full with something else that you won’t be thinking about it.</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>As you teach others, you will gain knowledge yourself. Whatever you do, to or for another person. Do, to or for, yourself.</li>
    </ul>
