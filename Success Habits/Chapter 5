<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.</li>
        <li>Every adversity carries with it, the seed of an equivalent benefit.</li>
        <li>You must know what you want. Become determined in your own mind that you’re going to get it. And decide what you’re going to give in return for it.</li>
        <li>The best part of your life will not come out of success, but out of your failures. Make up your mind that they mean nothing in your life except the challenge to greater effort.</li>
        <li>Any negative state of mind will destroy the power of faith, and will result in a negative conclusion. Your state of mind is everything. You must have a burning desire.</li>
    </ul>
