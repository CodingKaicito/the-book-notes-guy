    <ul>
        <li>Put more definition in your intentions.</li>
        <li>A great leader doesn’t take no for an answer, knows precisely what they want, and can pass on that information.</li>
        <li>When you tell a person to do something, you must be definite about it. Use WWWWH – What to do, where to do it, when to do it, why to do it, how to do it, and then make sure they do it. This method separates a successful and an unsuccessful individual.</li>
    </ul>
