    <ul>
        <li>To accurately think you must:</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Separate facts from fiction or evidence.</li>
        <li>Once you know the facts, you have made that separation.</li>
        <li>Separate factors into important and unimportant categories.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>You need to learn to separate important facts from unimportant facts, but most of all devote most of your time to important facts – facts that will be beneficial to you.</li>
        <li>Opinions are usually not useful or without value, because of bias.</li>
        <li>Most opinions are not worth anything at all.</li>
        <li>Don’t let anybody make up your mind for you about anything.</li>
        <li>Gossipers are NOT reliable sources.</li>
        <li>If you are an accurate thinker, you’ll pay no attention to what is said about you. You’ll pay more attention to seeing that the unkind things said about you are not true; and that’s your entire responsibility if you are an accurate thinker. Beyond that, you’ll pay no attention to what people say.</li>
        <li>Everything worthwhile in this world should have a price on it.</li>
        <li>Plans do not create themselves.</li>
    </ul>
