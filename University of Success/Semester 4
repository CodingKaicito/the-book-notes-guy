<h2>We first make our habits, and then our habits make us.</h2>
    <h2>Lesson 16, How to Find the Courage to Take Risks:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Human beings do need some stress. We were “designed” by evolution to survive in the stress of food chain competition. A certain amount of pressure is necessary for our health. Of course, too much stress, like too much sound, is bad. But no stress, like total silence, makes us unbalanced.</li>
        <li>Explore and experiment. Look for that balance between taking suicidal chances on one hand, and running from risking on the other. Some days will feel right for risks; others will feel better if you play it safe. Experiment to find out what’s best for that moment. Since anything new will always be stressful, judge yourself by your efforts. No matter what you try, there’s somebody else who probably does it better. The point is to find those things that let you feel exhilarated and alive. The point is to learn to season life’s banquet with those redolent spices of stress and risk.</li>
        <li>One of the things we’ve often seen are people sitting around waiting for “it” to happen, as though they’ll suddenly get some kind of badge of membership they can show to other people. But, like anything else done primarily for the benefit of the audience, it’s a performance that’s bound to flop. If you are standing on a hilltop looking out over the countryside and suddenly have that experience of flowing and being part of it all, but then try to condense that experience into a tourist snapshot for the folks back home, you’ll lose it in an instant. It can’t be canned. You can experience it but you can’t sell it. And in a sense that’s the greatest risk of all. You can’t possess it. You can’t “prove” it. You can only be it. You can let yourself go in what you do, or you can hold back. You can strive to immerse yourself, to take that risk of losing your identity in what you’re doing. Or, you can stiffly straight-arm your life to keep it at a safe distance. You can try to reduce everything into “explainable” experiences. You can label and classify all that you see in a desperate attempt to stay in control. Or you can stop strutting and fretting and let go.</li>
        <li>We learn best by losing ourselves. If we can be strong enough to just forget about who we are for a moment instead of taking ourselves so damn seriously, if we forget about what we think, what we believe, what we want—take the risk of forgetting ourselves—we learn with the grace of blossoming a flower. It takes the highest courage to use this self-surrender in any activity we undertake. But the rewards are equally high. We gain a peace, that sense of rightness, and most importantly, our full powers to create and grow.</li>
        <li>What kind of life do you want? How courageous will you be? The choice is yours.</li>
        <li>“The body learns instead of the mind.” In other words, when you are learning something it’s worth it to turn off, unplug, or tune out the mind for a little while. You can’t tell the mind to shut up because then it just talks back to you, but you can quietly note what it’s telling you, then switch to another channel for awhile.</li>
        <li>Immerse yourself in your <em>creative action</em>, let go and do it.</li>
        <li><em>Critically review</em>. You mentally stand back a little, take a distance and while the results. “Did it get me closer to where I want to be?”</li>
        <li>Fear of failure must paralyze you. Letting your self-respect depend on results makes you a slave to every whim of chance. Break free. <em>f you’re going to love yourself, love yourself no matter what.</em></li>
        <li>Be a strong coach for yourself. Encourage your own efforts. If you set a goal, but don’t reach it, you have a choice. You could put yourself down: “I <em>knew</em> I couldn’t. Maybe some people can change but I can’t. I just keep making the same mistakes over and over again. I’ll never get it together.” Or you can cheer yourself on: “I tried magnificently. I’m proud of me. I was truly immersed in the effort. I failed in my attempt. I accept that; I accept the pain. But I remain proud and love myself for my courage.”</li>
        <li>Learn to lose yourself in your efforts. Learn to let go and you will have gained true courage. Have the guts to face the light. Strive for as ,ice courage as you can. That doesn’t mean work yourself to the bone. Play is a vital need too. Have the courage to live a life where some days will be hard and some easy no matter how clever you are. Let go with love, and energy will fill you. Success is courageously living each moment as fully as possible. Success means the courage to flow, struggle, change, grow, and all the other contradictions of the human condition. <em>Success means being true to you.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 17, How to Become a Self-Motivator:</h2>
    <p>The biggest difference between a “wisher” and a “doer” is motivation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are no barriers you can’t overcome if you are learning to be motivated. I believe with all my heart that everything that touched your life is to make you a more deeply motivated person—who in turn can motivate others to higher goals.</li>
        <li>There is no way to learn to be a motivated person without being totally in older and committed to whatever you are engaged in!</li>
        <li>Someone else’s experience or story can never motivate you as deeply as your own.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>


    <h2>Lesson 18, How to Program Yourself for Success:</h2>
    <p>Without goals, and plans to reach them, you are like a ship that has set sail with no destination.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A goal is an objective you want to achieve. A plan is a specific way of reaching that goal. Big goals and plans are <em>ideas in your mind.</em></li>
        <li>All tangible objects began as goals, plans, or ideas in the minds of people.</li>
        <li>The world is changed by goals and plans conceived in the minds of men and women.</li>
        <li>Creativity in one area often helps with another.</li>
        <li>First, there is the area of your work. The place you are most likely to achieve money goals is in your world of work. There is the area of your marriage. Setting goals in this area my head off divorce in the future, or deepen an already satisfactory relationship.</li>
    </ul>
