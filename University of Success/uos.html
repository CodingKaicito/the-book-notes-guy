    <p>This book is broken up into 10 semesters with 5 lessons in each semester. This book taught me so much about how to succeed in everything you do, and this summary will pass on all the important information that I learned without you having to spend a dozen hours reading and writing a bunch of notes on this book. This is my summary of the book: University of Success by OG Mandino.</p>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 2, How to Fashion Your Own Brand of Success:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Putting in work gives you happiness.</li>
            <li>There are ups and downs in your day but a couple downs doesn’t mean it was a bad/unsuccessful day.</li>
            <li>A couple downs can lead to a lot of ups.</li>
            <li>One man’s meat is another man’s poison. (Not everyone likes what you like)</li>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 3, How to Count Your Blessings:</h3>
    <p>Feeling sorry for yourself, and your present condition, is not only a waste of energy but the worst habit you could possibly have.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</li>
            <li>”I had the blues because I had no shoes, until upon the street I met a man who had no feet.” Stop complaining because there are other people dealing with worse.</li>
            <li>Stop worrying about things that don’t matter.</li>
            <li>Count your blessings – not your problems.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Pay attention to little things because they add up.</li>

<h3>Lesson 6, How to Accept the Challenge of Success:</h3>
    <p>To succeed means that you may have to step out of line and march to the sound of your own drummer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We live in an age that has come to accept average.</li>
            <li>90% of our potential we will never use.</li>
            <li>We were not placed on this Earth to be little more than walking vegetables.</li>
            <li><i>NO ONE CONTROLS YOUR LIFE BUT YOU.</i></li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 7, How to Give Your Dreams a Chance to Come True:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop saying “I can’t”.</li>
            <li>Your only limitations, are those you set up in your own mind, or permit others to set up for you.</li>
            <li>Try everything because you don’t know something won’t work or is bad unless you try.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 8, How to Develop Your Strength to Seize Opportunities:</h3>
    <p>You may live in an imperfect world but the frontiers are not all closed and the doors are not all shut.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opportunity is not just for the other person. Make it for you.</li>
            <li>Live in the present. The past is gone, the future is unknown.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 9, How to Make the Most of Your Abilities:</h3>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 11, How to Transform Your Thoughts into Reality:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dreams are the seedlings of reality.</li>
            <li>Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 12, How to Use Your Greatest Power to Change Your Life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><i>You</i>, and only you, are in charge of your mind</li>
            <li>Those who fail, those who wallow in self-pity, those who always complain, do so because they fail to use the greatest power they possess, or they misuse it with disastrous results that bring grief to themselves and to those whose lives they touch.</li>
            <li>You have a great power. TO CHOOSE. No one can tell you what to do. You can choose.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h3>Lesson 13, How to Raise Your Self-Esteem and Develop Self-Confidence:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The only event in the entire world you can control is what you are thinking and feeling at the present instant—but that is enough! That’s all you need to be able to control.</li>
            <li>Yet, without realizing it—or intending to do so—you are moving through life with your brakes partially set. The horsepower is there, but the vast areas of potential are blocked, bottle up, restricted from effective application.</li>
            <li>When something goes badly, recognize what has happened—acknowledge the error—and then shift into the thought about how you will handle that kind of situation if it ever were to happen again.</li>
            <li>Allowing your thoughts and feelings about yourself to move in a positive direction is particularly important the last few minutes at night, just before you go to sleep. Just before you fall asleep is a very special time to be sure that you are directing your thoughts toward the things that you feel good about having done, or the activities that you are looking forward to in the future.</li>
        </ul>

<br>


<h2>Lesson 14, How to Win Your War Against Negative Feelings:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must not allow yourself to be railroaded into adopting stereotyped, humiliating attitudes toward yourself.</li>
            <li>People who are completely objective in appraising political trends or medical conditions or stock market movements or mechanical gadgets—or other people —are often totally blind to the irrationality of their false beliefs about themselves. Not only that; considerate of others, they can be ruthlessly vindictive toward themselves.</li>
            <li>Have you spent your past years worrying about some catastrophe that has never happened? Do you constantly criticize yourself for talking too much or not talking enough or talking incoherently? Is your self-blame so severe that your conversations have become contrived and dead? Are you so worried about money that nothing else matters to you? Do you watch your savings account suffer acute indigestion every time you must make a withdrawal, worrying over every dollar that is wasted? They are—negative beliefs that pull us down from our true level as human beings, offensive obsessions that disfigure our self-images, that destroy our aspirations for the happiness that is our reasonable expectation. They have a hypnotic effect which must be cancelled out. They cause failure.</li>
            <li>Indeed, we must war against all aspects of the “failure mechanism,” which is what I call the system of self-reinforcing negative symptoms which can disrupt an unaware individual’s positive instincts. For, just as certain positive predispositions can accelerate the happy functioning of a person’s success mechanism, so can negative forces build up with the speed of a rolling stone going downhill, producing chains of negative feedback within the individual which can lead only to defeat.</li>
        <li>There is nothing wrong with aggressiveness, properly channeled; to reach our goals we must at times be aggressive. But misdirected aggressiveness is a surefire symptom of failure, following on the heels of frustration, contributing to a vicious cycle of defeat.</li>
            <li><i>The insecure person is frequently quite competent but, living with impossible expectations, he tends to criticize himself constantly. His feelings of insecurity cause him to trip himself up so that he falls pathetically short of his true potentials.</i></li>
            <li>The uncertain person believes that if he does not make a decision, he is safe! He is safe from the criticisms he might receive if he took the chance and was proved wrong—safe from the consequences of a decision he made that backfired. This type of person must see himself as perfect; therefore, he cannot afford to be wrong. When a decision is necessary, he looks upon it as a life-or-death decision. If he makes the wrong choice, he will destroy his idealized picture of himself. Therefore, he may dawdle over a trivial decision for long periods of time, wasting his precious hours worrying. When he finally does make up his mind, his decision will be subject to distortions—and he will very likely blunder. The uncertain person cannot live fully because he is afraid to take the plunge and get his feet wet.</li>
            <li>If you’ve never failed at anything, it’s a certainty that you never really tried anything.</li>
        </ul>

<br>


<h2>Lesson 15, How to Benefit from The Art of Expectation:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Truly successful people always hold great expectations even though they may hedge a bit. Brave men, though fearful, are never afraid of fear. Healthy people have no time for sickness, and to the pure of heart things are not as impure as they seem.</li>
            <li>We can learn that if we have a propensity for fear, we have an even greater propensity for faith. If we think we are slated for failure, it may be because we know we are meant for success. Our negative expectations are our positive determinations gone astray, but they are not gone.</li>
        </ul>
