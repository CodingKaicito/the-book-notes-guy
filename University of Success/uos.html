    <p>This book is broken up into 10 semesters with 5 lessons in each semester. This book taught me so much about how to succeed in everything you do, and this summary will pass on all the important information that I learned without you having to spend a dozen hours reading and writing a bunch of notes on this book. This is my summary of the book: University of Success by OG Mandino.</p>

            <li>Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</li>
            <li>”I had the blues because I had no shoes, until upon the street I met a man who had no feet.” Stop complaining because there are other people dealing with worse.</li>

            <li>Your only limitations, are those you set up in your own mind, or permit others to set up for you.</li>
            <li>Try everything because you don’t know something won’t work or is bad unless you try.</li>
        </ul>
