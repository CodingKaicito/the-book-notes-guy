<h2>Chapter 1 (1-15)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main character is Heli Clame.</li>
<li></li>
<li>All Heli's personal information is in one microchip.</li>
<li>Heli's flaxen hair is near extinct. It grew like shaggy bales of hay stringing over his eyes and ears.</li>
<li>"Their" aim is to create the perfect race.</li>
<li>Grinnamon is the headmaster of Heli's school.</li>
<li>Grinnamon transferred Heli. They are transferring him in a "classic Neoteric Hovercraft." They went to a place off the grid. It is surrounded in bordering walls and a gate that says, "IDEA33."</li>
