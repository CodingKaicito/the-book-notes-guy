        These notes are broken up into 2 chapters per section. They will reflect
        on all the important information that I learned from this book without
        you having to spend many hours reading. This is my summary of the book:

            The Gladers found a bunch of people hung from the ceiling on a rope.
            They were the people who rescued the Gladers the day before.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thomas found a paper that said,
            <i>Teresa Agnes, Group A, Subject A1. The Betrayer.</i> on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Gladers broke into a room looking for Teresa but found a boy
            named Aris. He said he has never heard of a girl named Teresa and
            was put here last night. He said he was rescued from the Maze.

        <ul>
          <li>Aris was the only boy in his Maze.</li>
          <li>Aris can telepathically talk to Thomas just like Teresa.</li>
          <li>
            Aris thinks that "they" made a girl named Beth stab his friend,
            Rachel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aris said that "they" brought him here to separate him from the
            girls.
          </li>
          <li>Instead of "shuck" Aris says "stick."</li>
          <li>
            Aris has a tattoo on his neck that says,
            <i>Property of WICKED. Group B, Subject B1. The Partner.</i> He said
            it wasn't there last night. Then Minho's shirt shifted a bit and
            Thomas saw something on his neck. It read,
            <i>Property of WICKED. Group B, Subject B1. The Partner.</i> Then,
            all the Gladers ran around looking at each other's necks. They all
            had <i>Subject A</i> tatted on. But Thomas' neck read,
            <i>Subject A2. To be killed by Group B.</i>

          <li>Someone turned off the lights in the common area. Minho got them back on and all of the bodies were of gone.</li>
          <li>The sign outside the room where they found Aris didn't say <i>Teresa Agnes, Group A, Subject A1, The Betrayer.</i> anymore. It now said, </li>
