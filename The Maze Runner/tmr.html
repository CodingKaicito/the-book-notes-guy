    <p>This summary is broken up into 2 chapters per section. This summary will pass on all the important information that I learned from this book without you having to spend a dozen hours reading. This is my summary of the book: <cite>The Maze Runner.</cite></p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Chapters 1 & 2:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Thomas is the main character. He lost his memory. Alby greeted him. He was a dark-skinned boy with short-cropped hair and a face clean shaved. All the boys around Thomas were mid-teens to young adults. There were about 50-60 of them. Newt was taller than Alby and had long blond hair with veins sticking out of his muscled arms. Chuck was a "wee little fat shank" who is in charge of Thomas' sleep arrangements.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h2>Chapters 3 & 4:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gally was a tall, skinny boy with black hair who looked 15 or so. His nose was the size of a small fist.</li>
        </ul>
